## Author Notes:
## _____________
##
## This is the phpBB SEO Premod. 
##
## WARNING : Topic title injection in URL can be hard to deal with depending on the type of subjects your
## forum is about. In most cases phpBB SEO recommend the use of the phpBB SEO mixed mod Rewrite instead.
## Please read : http://boards.phpbb-seo.com/phpbb-seo-toolkit/phpbb-seo-mod-rewrites-vt66.html
##
## This Premod is and will be compatible to all phpBB SEO modules, specific install instructions may apply.
## phpBB SEO will provide patches to allow for other URL standards support upon request, 
## so that everyone can take advantage of the phpBB mod Rewrites enhancement without jeopardising his Page-Ranking.
##
##
## Char-sets :
## ___________
##
## 	phpBB3 uses UTF-8 as final encoding, and this should be enough to handle all cases. 
## UTF-8 is fully supported by this mod.
## The mod rewrite will only inject the ASCII Chars ( after removing all accents ) available in the titles.
## 
## For example : "[non ASCII chars] Software niño" will be formated this way prior to injection : "software-nino".
## It is still possible that some characters only having a decimal HTML/XML entity won't be handled properly at first.
## The method to filter these is simple, please ask for help in our forums.
##
## Migration :
## ___________
##
## If you are migration, eg if your forum is already indexed using different URLs, 
## you'll have to use another robots.txt and install the zero duplicate. 
## The migrating procedure will allow you to migrate and keep your previously indexed pages.
## Older links will be HTTP 301 redirected to the new ones. It is rather simple, but the solution depends on cases. 
## Let's meet in the Premod forum ( http://www.phpbb-seo.com/boards/phpbb-seo-premod-vf61/ ).

#-----[ DIY INSTRUCTIONS ]--------------------------------------------------
#
________________________________________
>>>>   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTION    <<<<<
________________________________________
___________
IMPORTANT :
________________________________________
Before you start, read this with caution.
=> For a smooth install :
	1) Upload all files and lunch www.yoursite.com/phpBB/ in your browser;
	2) Follow the installation / conversion / upgrade steps;
	3) Go to phpBB ACP : It's now time to play with settings described bellow;
	5) Generate your personalized .htaccess and upload or move it following the instructions;
	5) Test a rewritten URL, such as www.yoursite.com/phpBB/post1.html, if you end up with a 404 (not a phpBB message), go back to step 5;
	6) Activate URL rewriting in phpBB ACP and allow yourself some auto-congratulation :D
________________________________________

__________
Settings :
__________

The settings must be done before step 7 above for the generated .htaccess to be up to date.
Later modification will most likey require a new .htaccess as well as personalized redirections.


=> By Default, this mod will get rid of index.php for phpBB's index.
You can change this in phpbb_seo/phpbb_seo_class.php if you prefer.
Look for :

'index' => ($this->seo_opt['virtual_root'] ? 'forum' : '')

And replace with  :

'index' => 'forum'

or whatever you prefer.
This is mostly useful if you're running a portal in the folder where phpBB is installed. 

=> The first setting to do is to select which static part to use in your URLs. 

To do so, you can modify this in phpbb_seo/phpbb_seo_class.php :
	=> the-team :	
		'leaders' => 'the-team'

	=> announces :
		'global_announce' => 'announces'

 
	=> As well as forum ('forum' => 'forum'), topic ('topic' => 'topic'), post ('post' => 'post') and member ('user' = 'member')

	=> And the suffixes, if you don not like .html :
		$this->seo_ext = array( 'forum' => '.html', 'topic' => '.html', 'post' => '.html', 'user' => '.html', 'index' => (!empty($this->seo_static['index']) ? '.html' : ''), 'global_announce' => '/', 'leaders' => '.html', 'gz_ext' => '');

This settings will be taken into account while generating the .htaccess.

=> Other options are configurable on the setting page (step 7 of the above list).
Go to the "phpBB SEO Class Settings" page, and take your time to set up the class as you whish.

=> It is now time to play with your forum URLs (Mixed and Advanced mode). 
To do so, go to the "Forum URL management" page and start selecting good keywords for your forum URLs.
Take your time to do it, and remember that using the remove IDs option in the settings makes it a bit harder to build appropriate redirection, in case you edit the forum URLs later.
If you later create more forums, you'll just have to go to this page again an eventually update the 
new forum URL.
If not, the new forum URL will not be cached and the default one will be used (forum-title-fxx).

___________
NOTE: Cache
___________
The cache files are in the phpbb_seo_/cache/ folder.
phpbb_cache.php is the cached file containing both your settings and forum URLs.

The mod always creates a backups of the current cached file : 
	=> phpbb_cache.php.current is a copy of the phpbb_cache.php file.
	It will automatically be used in case phpbb_cache.php is deleted or corrupted (which should not occur but).
	=> phpbb_cache.php.old is a copy of the previous settings you had set, before the last update you performed.

You should backup these file when you update them, they are as crucial as you data base for your forum
since they are required for your forum URL to work properly.
So relax, this is just a basic precaution, you should not have trouble with these, 
but never is better, hence the backup.

____________
 .htaccess :
____________

On the phpBB SEO ACP module, go to the ".htaccess" page.
A personalised .htaccess will be generated. It's the first one to consider trying.
If the default suggestion does not work, you will be to try more options, and generate several alternative.
You'll find an empty .htaccess file in this mod's archive contrib/ folder, you can use it to paste the .htaccess content generated on the htaccess page or save it directly on the server.


Please take a look at : http://www.phpbb-seo.com/boards/seo-principles/locking-the-www-in-urls-vt30.html
to find out how to lock the use (or un use) of the www prefix in your domain's url.
This is a major Search Engine Optimisation issue to take care of the www prefix issue.

____________
robots.txt :
____________

You will find a sample robots.txt file in the contrib/ folder of this package.
The robots.txt file must be uploaded in your domain's root folder (can be different from the phpBB one).
You must obviously replace phpbb/ with your real phpBB installation folder (or with nothing if it's installed in the domain's root).
