## Author Notes:
## _____________
##
## This is the phpBB SEO Premod. 
##
## WARNING : Topic title injection in URL can be hard to deal with depending on the type of subjects your
## forum is about. In most cases phpBB SEO recommend the use of the phpBB SEO mixed mod Rewrite instead.
## Please read : http://boards.phpbb-seo.com/phpbb-seo-toolkit/phpbb-seo-mod-rewrites-vt66.html
##
## This Premod is and will be compatible to all phpBB SEO modules, specific install instructions may apply.
## phpBB SEO will provide patches to allow for other URL standards support upon request, 
## so that everyone can take advantage of the phpBB mod Rewrites enhancement without jeopardising his Page-Ranking.
##
##
## Char-sets :
## ___________
##
## 	phpBB3 uses UTF-8 as final encoding, and this should be enough to handle all cases. 
## UTF-8 is fully supported by this mod.
## The mod rewrite will only inject the ASCII Chars ( after removing all accents ) available in the titles.
## 
## For example : "[non ASCII chars] Software niño" will be formated this way prior to injection : "software-nino".
## It is still possible that some characters only having a decimal HTML/XML entity won't be handled properly at first.
## The method to filter these is simple, please ask for help in our forums.
##
## Migration :
## ___________
##
## If you are migration, eg if your forum is already indexed using different URLs, 
## you'll have to use another robots.txt and install the zero duplicate. 
## The migrating procedure will allow you to migrate and keep your previously indexed pages.
## Older links will be HTTP 301 redirected to the new ones. It is rather simple, but the solution depends on cases. 
## Let's meet in the Premod forum ( http://www.phpbb-seo.com/boards/phpbb-seo-premod-vf61/ ).

#-----[ DIY INSTRUCTIONS ]--------------------------------------------------
#

________________________________________
>>>>   UPDATE INSTRUCTION   	   <<<<<
________________________________________

Update 3.0.0 => 3.0.1 :
First, go to http://downloads.phpbb-seo.com/seo-url-premod-12/
where you'll be able to download the update packages
You can update using two method :
	1) Auto updating : "3.0.0 to 3.0.1 Auto update"
		- Upload the auto_update/install/*.* folder of the update package to install/*.*
		- Go to ACP => SYSTEM and follow instructions.
		The auto update method will take the eventual code change you have made into account, 
		and will attempt to merge the new files with your online modified ones.
		It's the safest method for most, the installer will tel you if it has trouble to update some files.
	2) Manual updating : "3.0.0 to 3.0.1 Changed Files"
		You'll find the modified file list in the modified/ folder of the update package.
		- Upload / merge / overwrite all file,
		- Upload the modified/install/*.* to install/*.*,
		- Run www.example.com/phpbb/install/database_update.php to update the DB.

The update will require some additional set up and .htaccess update.
Your forum URLs will stay exactly the same, but there are new options to URL rewrite the profiles and 
User Messages search pages.
User Messages search pages will change :
	We decided to go for a better url structure and to as well hanlde the sr (showresults, can be topics 
	or posts in search results) option.
	It's no big deal, but if you update, you'll need to keep the previous rewriterule you had in your 
	.htaccess for user messages pages.
	To do so, make a copy of your current .htaccess, generate a new one once you've updated, and then 
	grab the rewriterule you had in your old .htaccess after (the comment line is longer):

		# USER MESSAGES

	and copy it after :

		# HERE IS A GOOD PLACE TO ADD OTHER PHPBB RELATED REWRITERULES

	in your new .htaccess and the zero duplicate will do the rest ;)


Before you do so, you can change the way search user pages are rewrtten if you wish, if you as well change 
the profile URLs, then you'll need to keep the old profile rewriterule the same way in your new .htaccess.
If you encounter some difficulties to update the phpbb_seo_class.php file, for example if you modded it, 
you will just have to use the new file and edit it to re enter your previous customisations (static part & delimiters).
Once you will have updated, you will have to refresh your theme's cache as well as phpBB's cache 
(ACP => STYLE, Themes => Refresh).

________________________________________
>>>>   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTION    <<<<<
________________________________________
___________
IMPORTANT :
________________________________________
Before you start, read this with caution.
=> For a smooth install :
	1) Upload all files and lunch www.yoursite.com/phpBB/ in your browser;
	2) Follow the installation / conversion / upgrade steps;
	3) Go to phpBB ACP : It's now time to play with settings described bellow;
	4) Generate your personalized .htaccess and upload or move it following the instructions;
	5) Test a rewritten URL, such as www.yoursite.com/phpBB/post1.html, if you end up with a 404 (not a phpBB message), go back to step 5;
	6) Activate URL rewriting in phpBB ACP and allow yourself some auto-congratulation :D
	7) Activate the Zero duplicate is wise at this point.
________________________________________

__________
Settings :
__________

The settings must be done before step 4 above for the generated .htaccess to be up to date.
Later modification will most likey require a new .htaccess as well as personalized redirections.


=> By Default, this mod will get rid of index.php for phpBB's index.
You can change this in phpbb_seo/phpbb_seo_class.php if you prefer.
Look for :

'index' => ''

In this line of code :

		$this->seo_static = array( 'forum' => 'forum', 'topic' => 'topic', 'post' => 'post', 'user' => 'member', 'group' => 'group', 'index' => '', 'global_announce' => 'announces', 'leaders' => 'the-team', 'atopic' => 'active-topics', 'utopic' => 'unanswered', 'npost' => 'newposts', 'pagination' => 'page', 'gz_ext' => '.gz' );


And replace with  :

'index' => 'forum'

or whatever you may prefer.
This is mostly useful if you're running a portal in the folder where phpBB is installed. 

=> The first setting to do is to select which static part to use in your URLs. 

To do so, you can modify this line in phpbb_seo/phpbb_seo_class.php :

		$this->seo_static = array( 'forum' => 'forum', 'topic' => 'topic', 'post' => 'post', 'user' => 'member', 'group' => 'group', 'index' => '', 'global_announce' => 'announces', 'leaders' => 'the-team', 'atopic' => 'active-topics', 'utopic' => 'unanswered', 'npost' => 'newposts', 'pagination' => 'page', 'gz_ext' => '.gz' );

	=> the-team :	
		'leaders' => 'the-team'

	=> announces :
		'global_announce' => 'announces'

	=> Active topics :
		'atopic' => 'active-topics'

	=> Unaswered :
		'utopic' => 'unanswered'

	=> Newposts :
		'npost' => 'newposts'
 
	=> As well as forum ('forum' => 'forum'), topic ('topic' => 'topic'), post ('post' => 'post'), 
	member ('user' => 'member'), groups ('group' => 'group') and virtual folder pagination ('pagination' => 'page')

	=> And the suffixes, if you do not like .html :
		$this->seo_ext = array( 'forum' => '.html', 'topic' => '.html', 'post' => '.html', 'user' => '.html', 'group' => '.html',  'index' => '', 'global_announce' => '/', 'leaders' => '.html', 'atopic' => '.html', 'utopic' => '.html', 'npost' => '.html', 'pagination' => '.html', 'gz_ext' => '');

	Please note that suffixes may not be ".php" or empty, if you set a suffix to "/", 
	it will automatically activate the pagexx.html pagination.

Once set, these settings will be taken into account while generating the .htaccess.

=> Other options are configurable on the setting page (step 7 of the above list).
Go to the "phpBB SEO Class Settings" page, and take your time to set up the class as you wish.

=> It is now time to play with your forum URLs. 
To do so, go to the "Forum URL management" page and start selecting good keywords for your forum URLs.
Take your time to do it, and remember that using the remove IDs option in the settings makes it a bit harder to build appropriate redirection, in case you edit the forum URLs later.
If you later create more forums, you'll just have to go to this page again an eventually update the 
new forum URL.
If not, the new forum URL will not be cached and the default one will be used (forum-title-fxx).

___________
NOTE: Cache
___________
The cache files are in the phpbb_seo_/cache/ folder.
phpbb_cache.php is the cached file containing both your settings and forum URLs.

The mod always creates a backups of the current cached file : 
	=> phpbb_cache.php.current is a copy of the phpbb_cache.php file.
	It will automatically be used in case phpbb_cache.php is deleted or corrupted (which should not occur but).
	=> phpbb_cache.php.old is a copy of the previous settings you had set, before the last update you performed.

You should backup these file when you update them, they are as crucial as you data base for your forum
since they are required for your forum URL to work properly.
So relax, this is just a basic precaution, you should not have trouble with these, 
but never is better, hence the backup.

_________________
NOTE: .htaccess :
_________________

On the phpBB SEO ACP module, go to the ".htaccess" page.
A personalised .htaccess will be generated. It's the first one to consider trying.
If the default suggestion does not work, you will be to try more options, and generate several alternative.
You'll find an empty .htaccess file in this mod's archive contrib/ folder, you can use it to paste the .htaccess content generated on the htaccess page or save it directly on the server.


Please take a look at : http://www.phpbb-seo.com/boards/seo-principles/locking-the-www-in-urls-vt30.html
to find out how to lock the use (or non use) of the www prefix in your domain's url.
This is a major Search Engine Optimisation issue to take care of the www prefix issue.

__________________
NOTE: robots.txt :
__________________

You will find a sample robots.txt file in the contrib/ folder of this package.
The robots.txt file must be uploaded in your domain's root folder (can be different from the phpBB one).
You must obviously replace phpbb/ with your real phpBB installation folder (or with nothing if it's installed in the domain's root).

IMPORTANT :
	If your forum previously was indexed with the natural urls (viewtopic.php etc...), then you must make sure
	that the robots.txt advised for our mod rewrite is not installed, if so delete it from the server.
	This because we want to redirect old urls before we disallow them, it's crucial!
	In such case, a month or two after you activated the zero duplicate, you can safely implement the robots.txt.

__________________________________________________
NOTE: profile and user messages pages ID removing:
__________________________________________________

phpBB/member/nicknames VS  phpBB/nicknames-uxx.html

If you use profile and / or user messages pages ID removing, you should know that a custom urlencode 
will be used to circumvent a bug with mod_rewrite.
This imply that some chars like "&", "/", "#" and spaces will always be double encoded.
For example a user named rock&roll will require rock%2526roll (double urlencoded &) to be usable.
( http://www.php.net/urlencode => http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=34602 )

There are other issues with custom characters, like accents, which will add some urlencoded chars in urls.
It's not an SEO issue, since bots knows about urlencoding, but it can end up building pretty long url with multi byte characters.
This does not concern the a-zA-Z0-9 chars, underscore ("_"), hyphen ("-") and dot (".") included.
In phpbb_seo/phpbb_seo_class.php, you will no longer see different methods.

This of course means that the ID removing on profile and user messages pages is more comfy and universally efficient 
to use with alphanumeric chars user names (without accents). 

If you only allow alphanumeric chars for your user nicknames, then you can make the injection process faster by adding :

	return $url;

right after :

	function seo_url_encode( $url ) {

Remember that keeping the ID here will always work and that you still can simulate a folder structure for user messages pages.
